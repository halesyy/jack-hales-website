                  I recently had the pleasure of visiting Oman for the first time this year in 2024, during the Omani down-period in June. This was coming out of India, where I had to leave early due to the scorching heatwave and smog that hit in the same period, and my hotel room had no window. The relief was immediate once landing in Oman, where my hotel had a couple windows.

                  Firstly, during this off-period, the pricing for high-quality 5-star hotels in Muscat is incredible. I booked two - since I had extra time due to leaving India early. My first hotel was at <Link href="https://maanihotels.com/" target="_blank" size="lg">Maani Hotels</Link>, and my second apartment was at <Link href="https://www.frasershospitality.com/en/" target="_blank" size="lg">Fraser Suites</Link>. I'd recommend Fraser Suites for larger families, but I cannot explain in words how much relief I felt entering Maani Hotels. The place was so cool, and a really nice relaxing good-value hotel.

                  I met up with friends of friends: Hisham and Luoy, who very quickly became great friends. They are tour guides, and run their own touring company Oman Tours. We quickly discussed a lot of topics - from Religion, work, and culture.

                  Here's an effective breakdown of 3 day itineraries in Oman. This schedule worked perfectly for me as it balanced relaxation, cultural experiences, and exploration while accounting for the warm weather.

                     This itinerary offers a perfect blend of cultural immersion, historical exploration, and modern Omani life. The progression from a relaxed first day to an adventure-filled second day, followed by spiritual and modern experiences on the third day, helped me truly appreciate Oman's wide range of offerings.

                  Oman Fragrance: after visiting Oman Mall one evening, Hisham and Luoy invited me to a fragrance convention going on. I was suprised: a massive warehouse with some incredible fragrance, and I quickly learned that <strong>Omani's love fragrance</strong>. I brought about 3 fragrances, and was gifted one by Luoy.

                  I truly recommend checking out Oman. This is not an advertisement for Hisham and Luoy at Oman Tours, I just love them! Visit them on Instagram below, and view my shared post I made with Hisham and Luoy. Thanks to them for showing nothing but incredible hospitality and big hearts!
