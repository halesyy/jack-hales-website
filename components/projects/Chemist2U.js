            At Chemist2U I manage their pharmacy extraction pipeline. This is a key role for 
            providing catalogue services to their key providers, Uber, DoorDash, MenuLog, and so-forth.

            I install software, manage and extend catalogues, and coordinate unique projects and edge-cases

            I've started to manage what is best described as "accounts" for groups, making sure their 
            data divisions are comfortable with our data extraction, and creating unique
            systems to expand their power through our well-connected network.
