         <p>
            <strong>Pharma Portal is a software ecosystem focussed on affecting change management, and providing higher levels of efficiency and profitability.</strong> We help pharmacies, groups, suppliers and advertisers. It includes software, as well as a web application.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>Pharma Portal started in late 2022, and has been the most rewarding and challenging projects of my career thus far.</strong> I love maintaining it to this day. Technically, it includes deploying compiled software to edges, data engineering pipelines, encryption, database management, reporting systems, frontend presentation, and community building.
         </p>
         <p>
            More specifically, Pharma Portal provides:
            <ul className="ml-10 mt-4 list-disc">
               <li>Extraction from current key POS and Dispense systems in Australia</li>
               <li>Software deployment and maintenance</li>
               <li>Data storage and updating</li>
               <li>Outreach, registration, onboarding and installation assistance of software</li>
               <li>Various exception handling systems</li>
               <li>Bespoke reporting architecture - rapid development, experimentation and distribution</li>
               <li>Store, group, and suppliers all working from a single source of truth</li>
               <li>Configurable alert system</li>
               <li>User modification or fixing of data</li>
               <li>Store, group and supplier management</li>
               <li>So on...</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
            By being end-to-end on this project, it has taught me about all of the varying 
            roles and bodies involved in building an application:
            <ul className="ml-10 mt-4 list-disc">
               <li>Onboarding</li>
               <li>Support</li>
               <li>Application Development</li>
               <li>UI Development and Enhancement</li>
               <li>Interpreting Feedback</li>
               <li>Pivoting</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
            It's the last point - pivoting - which I believe the strongest in. I feel as if it's important to iterate, because once you can "feel" where the application is, things pop up, and ideas flow. With fellow business-people, being able to see and discuss a concept is incredibly valuable.
