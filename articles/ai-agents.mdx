Here, I am aiming not just to inform any dear reader, but also to help weed out the concrete concepts I have for AI Agents. Over the last few days, I've been ruminating on the positive impact that surrounding myself in gaussian-averaging-agents might have in order to increase the amount of personal working time I have to work on research I find captivating. To do this, I will attempt to break down where my time is spent regarding programming (as my main step-stone in progress), as well as professional affairs.

I'm mis-using the big words "philology" and "techno-philosophy" so I can put my mind in a higher-order place, though I think that is the **wrong approach**. I've done it in the past - being in "high-order" land promotes dreaming and imagination, whereas I want cold, hard, to-the-point performance.

I will be working on a running an [AI Agent research journal](https://www.jackhales.com/article/ai-agents-research-2024) similar to the prime number journal, where I broadly speak about the testing I am doing on this project.
