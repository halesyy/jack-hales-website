**Preface:** I want to define the minimum high-impact activities an agent can do within my workflow. Then, I want to evaluate the potential benefits of creating a permanent runtime, rather than a temporary "invoked" runtime.

### What is an AI Agent?

My conception of an AI Agent is something that runs in a temporary "invoked" runtime, or a permanent runtime, within a specific structure of a LLM-model. It involves inputs, as well as an attempt to coerce to a model-decided output, and an output parser to run certain actions based on the models output.

The inputs conventionally involve a mix of a chaotic user-request, as well as common instructions for how to respond. Something like: 

> "You will respond to user input. You will return output in JSON. Your options are ---. The users input is: ---."

With a bit more rigidity - but the basic idea is encapsulated above.

### Is an AI Agent necessary?

This is an important aspect to review, before jumping into AI Agent world. To help, I will start with what I commonly do at work, as well as some unusual exceptions.

- **Programming:** I am often taking ideas, and converting them into the code which is required to run those features.
