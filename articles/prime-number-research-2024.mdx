## 23rd of October, 2024

I've taken a renewed interest in this prime number research project for a perplexity of reasons. I read and re-read a lot of Nassim Taleb, and a few of his paraphrased points have been of great influence. Specifically:

**Black Swan, the middle of Chapter 11, discussing the 3-body problem:** Forecasting accrues tiny compounding errors, leading to large deviations.

This leads into chaos theory, the work of Pointcarre, chaos theory and topology.

Taleb has also discussed that tinkering gives him a higher-IQ than planning to solve problems.

**Finding bird poop:** Researchers looking into the universe picked up hums of old radiation from the birth of the universe. They assumed it was bird poop from radar dishes, instead they were shocked with their accidental discovery.

This all comes to provide me with accidental validation that the prime number generator I am working on, and the way I was going about it, was not so bad at all. Further, it might lead to some more tools for other practitioners on handling chaos and tinkering.

To recap what I am experimenting with: Denoting an equation which predicts the next prime number.

**Chaos theory, prediction application:** This is a unique application where the chaos of sequential prime numbers is very volatile and maddening, but the accuracy of the sample data, and ability to generate it - is logical and functional.

**Confirmation carefulness:** In my previous word, confirmation was the killer. You could have a very well-fit equation at primes 1-1,000,000, and then lose it all in the next million sequential primes.

**Manufactured tinkering:** I am not that smart with mathematics besides the basics, so I wrote a brute force equation builder. I then created a "fitness" algorithm to rank them. This provided me with very telling equations.

**P=NP:** Although there is no direct link to Nth-prime, and NP complexity - there is a growing amount of computational complexity involved in finding new primes. It's also crossed my mind that these "secondary equation problems" could exist, where algorithmic problems can be solved mathematically. I have no backup for this idea!

Now that I've preambled, I am going to update this with my findings as I find them - like a journal - to assist in the valuable art of seeing events as they occur.

### Creating Equations

Creating equations is an important piece of the puzzle. My first algorithm was very inefficient, and could take hours to find valuable equations by brute-forcing. My aim is to play around with building a quicker algorithm generator by understanding the form of equations deeper.

I'm also concerned that there might be logical functions that are needed that do not exist in existing mathematics which are required to express the logical pattern of primes. I cannot determine this, but if needed, I will be able to bake in custom functions into this interpreter.

- [This](https://github.com/halesyy/brute-primes/tree/main) is where I left off in April last year, and I did have an interesting idea - encoding equations into integer or float matrixes, so generating could done much quicker.
- The messy initial approach to generating equations, which I did in [my first approach in Jan 2022](https://github.com/halesyy/lol-primes/blob/main/solver/iter.py#L59), is to load in an array of possible equation parts, and generate N parts to try to successfully get an equation. Test it. If it passes, it can be used. This leads to *some* valid equations, but most aren't.
- I'm going to have a go at building an array-based interpreter which can then construct into an expression. I am skeptical, but it might yield some better and more efficient analysis.

The above are 3 approaches to creating equations.

### The best we've got from attempt 1 and 2

The best equation I was able to fit was:

> 3*log(x,7)

Also:

> e^cos(x) + e*x
