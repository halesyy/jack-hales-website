There is **a melancholic feeling** writing these lines, and I am unsure why specifically. As an individual, I am faced with a lot of decisions right now, and a lot of expectations weigh high. It's November 17th, 2024 - the clouds are dark overhead, and I'm preparing for a large storm at my home. I managed to get in ~15 minutes of a walk near my current place in Tura Beach in the forest, for a short expore.

Everything is remarkable in my life, and I constantly know this and appreciate it. Though, my main want now is **the ability to focus, deeply, on important problems** - since it is the most satisfying work I can do, and I am effective in that space.

Taleb is theraputic in this area. Specifically Black Swan, which I am re-reading for about the 4th time currently.

The following are a basket of problems I want to put more work into:

- [Prime number research](https://www.jackhales.com/article/prime-number-research-2024)
- Prediction in sports & odds markets
- AI agent discovery

Alongside these, are my work commitments. Myself and my business partner are utterly aligned to reducing our workload so we can focus on other opportunities, which I am blessed to be aligned with in that sense.

It's important for me to maximise my "positive black swan potential" in both the company I run, as well as the things of interest I work with personally, which are not within the company. **Personally:** I can maximise my own personal flavour on research, and from the **Company:** I can operate professionally, navigating unique business issues and solutions, and create mutual synergies in the business world, helping everyone.

To benefit **both**, the one personal project which also works in the Company world, is the **AI agent** project. This project involves using my knowledge of gaussian models and their limits to understand and inform the imapct of models and their deployment in working environments. I see how they are trained on the average, and to reduce volatility in answers, and **there is an important place in the world for that sort of temperament** which creates productivity.

To see my definition on the philological, and techno-philosophical approach to this Agent project, you can see [my more technical article](https://www.agentive.dev/article/agentic-user-parsers) which is a bit out-dated, or my [continued Jack Hales article]() I've done today.

If I am able to "automate myself out of a job" (specifically the programming component), whilst still having the skin in the game within my role to direct and receive the positive and negative aspects of the work, then I will have more free time in order to focus on the above projects which contain positive black swans for myself, and the greater community.

The other side is to ignore or semi-integrate AI, and continue attempting to harness positive black swans in the professional environment. Also a great and fine backup endevour!

To conclude it on "pathways and space" - this is my goal to take a brief step back, in order to hopefully open up space for future work. If it does not work out - I will be back working on the projects in normal fashion. If I am ever gone, I urge others who get the same pleasure I did with the work, to continue the work wholeheartedly.
